A repository of tutorials, assets, and configs for everything I use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains configurations and such for my own personal use, and everything is pretty much set to how I use them.
> 
> If you've a question about anything feel free to create an issue, but please don't expect me to customize something for your needs ❤️ The StreamerBot docs have more than enough resources, as well as a great amount of tutorials online such as from [Andilippi](https://youtube.com/@andilippi) and [Nutty](https://www.youtube.com/@nuttylmao)
